# NeurOne - High-performance Motor Unit-Computer Interface for the Paralyzed
Repository containing the manual for NeurOne - High-performance Motor Unit-Computer Interface for the Paralyzed. \
The executable can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/175JMZU_GW34g8HVj5uf6TwdNbxydxHVN/view?usp=sharing). \
Developed by [Dominik Braun](https://www.nsquared.tf.fau.de/person/dominik-braun/).

# Setup
1) Download "NeurOne.zip" from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/175JMZU_GW34g8HVj5uf6TwdNbxydxHVN/view?usp=sharing)
2) Unzip the compressed folder containing the executable and resources needed to start NeurOne
3) Download and install [OT Biolab Light](https://www.otbioelettronica.it/files/47/Software/148/OTBioLab-v1592.exe) from [OT Bioelettronica SRL](https://www.otbioelettronica.it/) \
   Note: By installing OT BioLab+, OT Biolab Light is installed concurrently

# Reference
The foundational decomposition technique employed by NeurOne was derived from a prior work by [Francesco Negro et al.](10.1088/1741-2560/13/2/026027)<sup>[1]</sup>.

If you incorporate NeurOne into your experimental protocol, we kindly request that you reference the following preprint for proper attribution and acknowledgment.
